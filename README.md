Hi, I’m @honzabe

I enjoy cyling, hiking, coding and writing.

My pet projects:

[severe case of midlife crisis](https://crisis40.com/english/) - a blog about trying to find joy in life (or at least trying to find the humorous side of things) while getting older and decaying slowly (written in English, Spanish and Czech).
