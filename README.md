Hi, I’m @honzabe

I enjoy cyling, hiking, coding and writing.

\
My pet projects:

[Ungibberish](https://ungibberish.com/) will help you learn a foreign language

[Anajour](https://anajour.com/) is a journaling app with tools for simple data analysis and visualization

[FIT file viewer](https://anajour.com/fit-file-viewer) will show you your training data as nice-looking charts

honzabe/honzabe is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
